Code for Domain Interpolation using GP models implemented in GPyTorch. 

==========================================

/Data Generator/ 
contains scripts for generating data using a finite element solver

/Datasets/ 
Datasets used to train each GP model

/Finite Element Solver (For Reference Only)/ 
contains previously written FEM code, not a part of this project (use pre-generated data instead)

/Full Solution Prediction/
contains relevant script and settings for independent trained models (to save time retraining)

/GP Fitting/
contains relevant script, edited as described in report for each experiment
