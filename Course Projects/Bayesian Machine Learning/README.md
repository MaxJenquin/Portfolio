# Bayesian Machine Learning
 This project was assigned as an end-of-semester research project for ORIE 6741, Bayesian
 Machine Learning, in the fall semester of 2018. It was joint work with Christophe Bonneville.  
 
 The goal was to recreate dynamics of PDE systems using Gaussian Processes whose kernels 
 represented the structure of the differential operator in question. Based largely on the work
 of Raissi and Karniadakis (cited in the report), this approach proved both interesting and 
 challenging to implement, and in fact worked better with simple base kernels due to the 
 structural complexity of high-order differential operators.  
 
 Code for this project is in MATLAB because that's what Raissi and Karniadakis used (allowing us
 to borrow some pre-built machinery), and served only to produce plots and tables for the report.
