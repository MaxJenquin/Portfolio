# Topics in Numerical Analysis: Ten Influential Algorithms of the 20th Century
 This project was assigned as an end-of-semester research project for MATH 7270, Topics in
 Numerical Analysis: Ten Influential Algorithms of the 20th Century, in the spring semester of 2019.  
 
 The goal was to determine the extent to which fast algorithms for specifically structured
 Gaussian process contexts (1-dimensional grid-structured input variables) allowed more
 flexible use of the model class. Specifically, the aim was to determine the maximum input
 rate such a model could 'keep up with' if used as an online or real-time data model for time
 series.  

 Code for this project was written in Python, using the PyTorch-based GP library GPyTorch. It 
 served only to produce relevant figures and tables for the report.
