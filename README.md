# Portfolio
 A rough portfolio of code and projects for those who would like to see them.  
 
 Within this repository you will find a number of course projects and associated code,
 as well as any paper preprints or published work I have produced.  
 
 All reports and papers are finished products (or in the case of publications under review, 
 nearly finished products).
 
 However, the code is universally unpolished and not fit for publication or use, and often
 represents trial and error, workarounds that would not make it in to any respectable codebase,
 and a distinct lack of clarifying comments.  
 
 While I plan to polish this code and replace it with a more presentable and useable version,
 time constraints have thus far kept me from doing so.  
 
 Please email me at mrj89@cornell.edu if you have any questions.
